                    It all started when I returned to Bilbao, after a long period working in England. As a musician, DJ and collector of vinyl music, mainly focused on the 60's and 70's (Blues, Jazz, Psychedelia, Soul, Rock...), I realized the lack of music of those styles in vinyl format in my city.
                    Despite the pressing crisis of the music industry, I deduced that if I was a vinyl junkie and needed my fix, there had to be more like me. So I searched for a market in the bustling Casco Viejo, in the increasingly less gray Bilbao and what started as a modest store with four records, today is CornerShop Records and has become a national reference with thousands of records in original format and out-of-print editions in stock.
                    This is the web that I present, I hope you enjoy it.

                                Placing an order is very easy. Simply add the product to the cart by clicking on the add to cart button. Once added, an icon with the units in the basket will be displayed in the upper right corner.  From here you will be able to review, delete or add units of the products previously added. For any consultation you will only have to click on the basket, to visualize again this content. You can process the order with the products included by clicking on the ORDER button located in the lower area.

                                On the next screen, you will have to select the country where you want to receive the order and the way you want to receive it (Agency or Post Office). Once selected, you will have to identify yourself if you have already done it in the past.

                                From this first registration, you will be able to purchase products in the future, receive information about offers and promotions, know the status of your orders... Your personal data will be registered in your customer file, so you will not need to fill them in again for future purchases.

                        <p>
                            The cookie law is an obligation that must be complied with by websites that make use of this type of information, except those that present a service expressly requested by the user or that are strictly necessary to allow communication between the user's equipment and the network.
                            Article 22 of the Law of Services of the Information Society and Electronic Commerce (LSSI) is the one that regulates this regulation although it has been subsequently amended by Royal Decree-Law 13/2012.
                            We mentioned this in the post What are cookies? How does the law apply to us? where we also explained what type of cookies must comply with the law, which ones are exempt and the requirements that the website must meet. One of these requirements was to have a cookie policy. In this post we will specify what are the elements that should contain the policy of our website.
                            It should be noted that if for example we use Google Analytics to measure traffic and accesses to our website, we are already installing and using cookies. The most common way to comply with cookie regulations is that, in addition to the notice where we ask for consent for their use, we detail the policy as another aspect of the legal notice of the website and that it is permanently accessible and available to the user, as indicated by law. Therefore in the "legal notice" will be detailed all aspects that legally must comply with the site, also offering the user information about the website (purpose, responsible for the website, contact, etc.).
